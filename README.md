# make fun with lines
This project is made in visual studio 2017. so i don't know if it will work fine with older versions also......if it is opening then perform following steps:
first download the project
then open Line folder
open Line.csproj
now your visual studio will be open 
run the program
make it(form, which will come after running the project) full screen and press on go
you can change no of lines, angle and others by entering their value..............
get different shaps and animations
try typing no of lines more than 100000 and see the cool stuff...
